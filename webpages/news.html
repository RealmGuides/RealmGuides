    THE DAMNED FRONTIER UPDATE NOTES

NEW CHAMPION: RAUM, RAGE OF THE ABYSS

LORE
All tremble at the mere mention of his name. He is wrath. He is fury. He is Raum, Rage of the Abyss. Consumed by burning conflict, tempered in the Abyss, his purpose is clear — annihilation. He has fought and triumphed over every entity in those war-scarred plains, shattering every soul that stands against his might. Few remain who are still worthy of his attention, and their conflicts grow stale. Now, he finds himself summoned to the Realm, a fertile ground teeming with new victims whose souls are too well-connected to their bodies.

BUG FIXES
Champions
Cassie
Fixed an issue where Night Bane Cassie had a red spot on her cape. (We needed extra-strong detergent to get that out.)
Dredge
Fixed an issue where Golden Dredge displayed the incorrect 1P textures.
Furia
Fixed a false-fire issue where Kindle Soul’s animation would play, but the healing effect would not be triggered.
Grover
Fixed an issue where Grover’s Pick Up card did not function.
Imani
Fixed an issue where firing fully-charged Pyre Balls in quick succession while using Mana Rift sometimes used the left-offset animation instead of always using the right-offset animation.
Inara
Fixed an issue where Inara’s Sunstone skin had untextured hair.
Io
Fixed an issue where Moonlight would sometimes not target a teammate when Io’s cursor passed over them.
Fixed an issue with Io bot where it would not summon Luna or heal for a significant length of time without stopping with Moonlight.
Fixed an issue where Luna could get stuck inside the Payload.
Koga
Fixed an issue where Koga’s Skewer ability would sometimes not fire properly at low energy levels (especially when using the Dragon Fangs talent).
Fixed an issue where Koga’s abilities could sometimes consume energy but not activate properly on higher ping values (especially Shadow Step).
Maeve
Fixed an issue where Nine Lives could rarely not activate properly if used immediately following Pounce.
Sha Lin
Fixed an issue where Players could sometimes not hear Sha Lin’s withdraw audio cue.
Skye
Fixed an issue where Street Style Skye’s “Return to Base” voice line played random voice lines from her Voice Pack instead of the intended voice line.
General
Fixed an issue where the text on the Mastery Rewards button in the Champions tab was not centered properly.
Fixed an issue where the “Joining Match” UI in the top left corner did not display as you were loading into the match.
Fixed various localization issues in Japanese and Spanish, as well as some pieces of text that had localization issues in all languages.
Fixed an issue where Champion models would not reload properly on the Battle Pass screen when tabbing to the Challenges tab and tabbing back to the Home tab.
Fixed an issue where the EULA would slightly overlap with the Paladins logo on consoles.
Fixed an issue with some direct purchase skins not having the proper purchasing flow in the Champions menu.
Fixed an issue where the text describing the PS+ discount for Battle Pass levels overlaps with the scroll bar on the Battle Pass Level Purchase window.
Fixed an issue where Champion names would still display twice on some Champion skins in the Loading Screen.
Fixed an issue where the Battle Pass icon was sometimes off center on the Battle Pass Level Up screen.
Fixed an issue with the Remix skins and Redux Strix where they would stop playing their skin-specific music after a round ended, when they dismounted from a Speeder mount, or after they became Polymorphed.
Fixed an issue where skins that were both in chests and were directly purchasable did not show their Direct Purchase price properly.
Fixed an issue where Battle Pass skins were not displayed as the leftmost item on the Battle Pass Level Up screen.
Fixed issues where Players could use the Emote Wheel to continuously charge or fire Weapon Shots without holding down their Primary Fire button.
Fixed some audio issues on the Dragon Arena Team Deathmatch map where Audio could sometimes cut out for brief periods of time, especially on console.
Fixed an issue where the Point Location UI indicator was offset from the Capture Point or Payload Cart in ultrawide resolutions.
Fixed an issue where Spectator would incorrectly display “Blue Team” as having captured the objective if Blue Team triggered Overtime but Red Team actually captured the objective.
Fixed an issue where Battle Pass music would stop playing in favor of the Main Menu music if the Options menu was opened while viewing the Battle Pass or Battle Pass Challenges.
Under Investigation
Delay in Custom lobbies in some regions.
Issues with Players in a party rarely not getting into the Match Lobby with the rest of their party.
Top Play camera can focus on Luna rather than the Champion who got Top Play.
Players can respawn with VFX stuck on their 1P camera or 3P model, or in the incorrect camera/zoom state.
