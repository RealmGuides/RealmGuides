    Io Guide by Glitchette<br>
-------------------------------------<br><br><br>

Pros:  <br>
Versatile <br>
Good main weapon, no drop off damage, no projectile drop <br>
(Life Link only) Heal at two places at the same time <br>
Generally safe, dying is uncommon if you know what you are doing <br>
Game-changing ult <br>
You can zone with Luna, and catch flanks <br>
Decent self sustain with the right cards <br>
Luna can stun every 15 seconds, disabling flanks / certain tank shields <br>
Luna can capture points / push payload <br>
Luna has high base health <br>
Luna can block shots / ults <br>
Good pocket healer with Goddess Blessing and Swift Arrows (40% MS + 25% DR) <br>
Luna can double as a makeshift tank <br>
Can redeploy luna quickly with the Spirit Arrows card <br><br>

Cons: <br>
Can't shoot and heal at the same time <br>
Relatively low HP/s (150 Heal per second) <br>
Lacking if Luna is down <br>
Cauterize impacts her heal badly ( Caut 1 = 105 | Caut 2 = 60 | Caut 3 = 15 HP/s) <br>
Good moonlight recovery requires either being near your fox or shooting the enemy depending on loadout <br>
Luna dies quickly to multiple damages / champions running bulldozer <br>

<br><br><br><br>
io does this that and this and can do this and that and dies to this that and this is a recommended build for this guide on this map and bla bla bla bla bla
