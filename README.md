Currently I am just using a readme file as a placeholder, as it looks better than just having a blank html file;


Io:
-------------
Pros:    
‣ Versatile  
‣ Good main weapon, no drop off damage, no projectile drop  
‣ (Life Link only) Heal at two places at the same time  
‣ Generally safe, dying is uncommon if you know what you are doing  
‣ Game-changing ult  
‣ You can zone with Luna, and catch flanks  
‣ Decent self sustain with the right cards  
‣ Luna can stun every 15 seconds, disabling flanks / certain tank shields  
‣ Luna can capture points / push payload  
‣ Luna has high base health  
‣ Luna can block shots / ults  
‣ Good pocket healer with Goddess Blessing and Swift Arrows (40% MS + 25% DR)  
‣ Luna can double as a makeshift tank  
‣ Can redeploy luna quickly with the Spirit Arrows card  

Cons:  
‣ Can't shoot and heal at the same time  
‣ Relatively low HP/s (150 Heal per second)  
‣ Lacking if Luna is down  
‣ Cauterize impacts her heal badly ( Caut 1 = 105 | Caut 2 = 60 | Caut 3 = 15 HP/s)  
‣ Good moonlight recovery requires either being near your fox or shooting the enemy depending on loadout  
‣ Luna dies quickly to multiple damages / champions running bulldozer
